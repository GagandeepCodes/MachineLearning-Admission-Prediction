**Introduction** <br><br>
In today’s world, it is getting more and more difficult to get into prestigious universities in today's competitive academic environment. The difficult selection criteria, which include letters of recommendation, personal statements, standardized test scores, and academic accomplishments, must be met by applicants. There is frequently close rivalry during this process as candidates try to establish themselves as the most qualified and worthy ones.

<br>

**Background**<br><br>
Recent years have seen massive changes in the higher education landscape, as seen by an increase in the quantity and variety of applications that universities across the globe have been receiving. Applications are coming in from a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and places, which reflects the expanding goals and global perspectives of students.

University admissions committees have been faced with the difficult task of evaluating a diverse pool of applicants as a result of this influx. These committees have historically evaluated candidates' qualifications and likelihood of academic success using a combination of qualitative and quantitative measures.

<br>

**Proposed Idea** <br> <br>
By utilizing a variety of machine learning algorithms and offering in-depth analyses of the effects of each feature in the dataset, the suggested solution to the university admission prediction problem constitutes an important upgrade over the current methodology. With this suggested solution, applicants and academic institutions should be able to make better decisions regarding predictive accuracy, model understanding, and decision-making skills.
<br><br>
This project's main goal is to create a reliable model that can accurately predict an applicant's chances of getting accepted into a university by utilizing the power of machine learning and predictive analytics. The model seeks to provide a thorough evaluation of an applicant's profile by combining a number of variables, including GRE and TOEFL scores, Statements of Purpose (SOP), Letters of Recommendation (LOR), and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).

<br><br>

**Result** <br><br>
Data Preparation and Model Training:

1. We collected a dataset containing features such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and admission outcomes (admitted or not admitted).
2. After preprocessing steps, including dropping irrelevant columns and handling missing values, we divided the dataset into training and testing sets (67% training, 33% testing).
3. Each algorithm was trained using the training set to learn patterns and relationships in the data.

<br>

Model Evaluation and Prediction : 

Model evaluation means how accurately the machine learning algorithms predict admission outcomes (admitted or not admitted) based on features like GRE scores, TOEFL scores, SOP, LOR, and CGPA. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to measure the model's performance. Prediction refers to using the trained models to predict whether a new applicant is likely to be admitted or not based on their input data.

In this model if a candidate's Chance of Admit is greater than 80%, the candidate will receive the 1 label otherwise it will be labeled as 0.
